Mission:
- Review one changed area for security and ownership safety.

Focus:
- authentication, session, and token boundaries
- exchange API-key handling and secret storage
- ownership isolation and data exposure
- runtime abuse, order safety, and risky business logic guards

Rules:
- Findings by severity.
- Include file references.
- Suggest minimal safe fixes.
- Keep money-impacting behavior, live-runtime safety, and deployment side
  effects explicit in the review.

Output:
1) Findings
2) Residual risks
3) Required follow-up tasks

## AI And Security Hardening Gate

- Validate the global security rule: AI systems must be tested against prompt injection, data leakage, and unauthorized access before deployment.
- For AI changes, require `AI_TESTING_PROTOCOL.md` scenarios and red-team evidence before recommending completion.
- Test prompt injection, role override, hidden instruction extraction, data leakage, and cross-user or cross-tenant access attempts.
- Block deployment when fail-closed behavior, ownership boundaries, or secret handling evidence is missing.
