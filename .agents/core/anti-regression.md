# Anti-Regression System

Last updated: 2026-05-07

## Purpose

This system prevents autonomous iterations from improving one area while
silently breaking another. Use it before and after every code change, and use a
concise version for docs-only changes.

## Mandatory Checks

Every meaningful change must answer:

- Impact: what user journey, runtime flow, API route, module, DB model, worker,
  UI route, or doc source-of-truth can this affect?
- Dependencies: which shared helpers, schemas, translation keys, generated
  clients, migrations, env vars, and queues depend on it?
- Flow: does the whole flow still work from UI to API to service to DB or
  worker and back?
- Backend/frontend parity: do API response shapes, web types, i18n labels, and
  rendering semantics match?
- States: are loading, empty, error, success, disabled, and stale data states
  handled?
- UI consistency: does the change reuse shared design patterns and avoid
  developer-looking UI?
- Responsiveness: does the UI work on desktop, tablet, mobile, pointer, touch,
  and keyboard where relevant?
- Type safety: do TypeScript, validation, and schema contracts prove the
  shape?
- Dead code: did the change leave unused branches, stale tests, old helpers, or
  unreachable paths?
- Duplication: did it duplicate domain logic, label mappings, formatting,
  runtime decisions, or API/client contracts?

## Risk Classification

Use the highest applicable risk:

- P0: live trading, auth, secrets, money movement, production health, data loss
- P1: backend/frontend contract, runtime state, DB schema, critical UX journey
- P2: localized UI, styling, docs, tests, maintainability, low-risk refactor

P0 and P1 changes require stronger validation and explicit fail-closed review.

## Regression Hunt Procedure

1. Identify the canonical contract.
2. Search for all consumers of the changed surface.
3. Compare current implementation to the contract.
4. Add or update focused tests for any bug or future drift risk.
5. Run the strongest relevant validation pack.
6. Record unresolved risks in `.agents/state/regression-log.md`.

## Backend/API Regression Traps

- API read models must not hide runtime truth required by operator surfaces.
- Money-impacting actions must use canonical ownership before compatibility
  fallbacks.
- LIVE behavior must not silently downgrade to PAPER or local-only semantics.
- Exchange-backed lifecycle rows must not be locally rewritten in ways that
  contradict exchange truth.
- Readiness must include critical dependencies required by the actual runtime.

## Frontend/UI Regression Traps

- Do not show raw backend enum strings unless the contract says so.
- Route-owned copy must stay in the route namespace; shared helpers may return
  suffixes or semantic keys, not route-specific labels.
- Loading, empty, error, success, blocked, and disabled states must be explicit.
- Avoid extra badges, labels, panels, or debug text that make the UI feel like
  developer tooling.
- Do not invent fallback values where absence is meaningful.
- Do not introduce local style inventions when a shared UI pattern exists.

## Documentation Regression Traps

- Architecture truth belongs in `docs/architecture/`.
- Flow truth belongs in `docs/pipelines/` and `docs/flows/`.
- API/client contract truth belongs in `docs/contracts/` or architecture
  reference contracts.
- Testing strategy truth belongs in `docs/testing/` and
  `docs/engineering/testing.md`.
- Planning docs must not become permanent architecture truth.
