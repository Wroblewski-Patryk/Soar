# Module Confidence Ledger

Last updated: 2026-05-14

## Purpose

This ledger is the quick reality map for Soar. It tracks whether each important
trading, bot, backtest, exchange, dashboard, subscription, and operations
journey is implemented, verified, broken, blocked, or unknown. Keep it honest.
Do not turn uncertainty into optimism.

## Status Vocabulary

- `NOT_STARTED`: no meaningful implementation exists.
- `IN_PROGRESS`: implementation is actively changing.
- `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_VERIFIED`: code exists, but current proof is missing.
- `PARTIAL`: some scenarios pass, but important scenarios are missing or stale.
- `VERIFIED`: current evidence proves the journey for the target scope.
- `BROKEN`: a reproducible defect exists.
- `BLOCKED`: verification or implementation is blocked by access, decision,
  environment, dependency, or missing input.
- `DEFERRED`: explicitly out of the current release scope.

## Confidence Rules

- `High`: fresh reproducible evidence exists for the real journey.
- `Medium`: good local proof exists, but target, edge-case, or freshness is
  incomplete.
- `Low`: evidence is missing, stale, inferred, or chat-only.

Web Auth/Profile proof passed (`13` files, `48` tests), covering middleware, AuthContext, login/register forms/hooks/types, public auth cache contract, profile page, API-key form/list, security form, and basic profile form. This slice also tightened test env restoration for JWT rotation and API-key encryption keyring variables. 2026-05-14 `docs/operations/prod-security-exchange-proof-2fc90a08-2026-05-14.md` passed on production: security headers are present, authenticated profile reads are `no-store`, unauthenticated protected/ops/metrics routes fail closed, API-key list responses are redacted, untrusted Origin receives controlled `403`, unsupported exchange probe fails closed without stored secrets in artifacts, and authenticated readiness details require auth. | Current V1 local and production-safe protected security proof is covered. External independent security review remains a separate governance follow-up and should not be represented as automated proof. | Keep proof fresh after future deploys; schedule external independent review as a governance follow-up before broader public launch. | QA/Test + Security + Backend Builder + Frontend Builder | 2026-05-14 |

Local admin route audit passed with a throwaway admin, and Edge/CDP screenshots rendered `/admin/subscriptions` and `/admin/users` with no framework overlay. `V1-SUBSCRIPTIONS-FOCUSED-TESTS-2026-05-12` adds focused module coverage for invalid entitlement fallback and FREE-plan LIVE trading fail-closed behavior (`2/2`). `V1-API-SUBSCRIPTIONS-DOC-TRUTH-2026-05-12` aligns the API Subscriptions doc to the current checkout/admin/profile V1 boundary. `V1-MANUAL-PAYMENT-METADATA-CLEANUP-2026-05-12` removes placeholder wording from manual checkout metadata and passes focused profile subscription checkout proof (`8/8`). | Local API/Web/protected route proof is covered. Production admin clickthrough with approved non-destructive data remains missing. | Run production admin clickthrough with approved non-destructive data and entitlement checks before marking verified. | QA/Test + Backend Builder + Frontend Builder | 2026-05-12 |
| SOAR-OPERATIONS-001 | Operations | Deployment smoke, rollback guard/proof, SLO evidence, release gates, alerts, backup/restore, and liveimport readback | P0 | VERIFIED | High | 2026-05-13 `V1-TARGET-RELEASE-GATE-PASS-00169D7F-2026-05-13`: final `LIVEIMPORT-03` passed for `TRXUSDT`; final preflight has no blockers; production target-only V1 release gate is `ready`; build-info freshness, post-deploy smoke, runtime freshness, and rollback guard passed against deployed `00169d7f`. 2026-05-14 `V1-PROTECTED-OPS-GATE-457BCE05-2026-05-14`: current candidate `457bce05` is deployed; protected runtime freshness passes, rollback proof passes with `shouldRollback=false` and no alerts, authenticated production UI clickthrough passes, controlled no-order-guard `LIVEIMPORT-03` readback passes for `TRXUSDT`, activation audit/plan are fresh, RC external gates/sign-off/checklist are fresh/pass, production backup/restore drill passes through `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://codex-vps`, final preflight is ready, and the full non-dry-run release gate reports `Readiness: ready` with guardrails, typecheck, build, go-live smoke, deploy smoke, runtime freshness, and rollback guard all passing. | Current V1 protected operations release gate is verified for deployed `457bce05`. Separate LIVE+PAPER simultaneous runtime proof remains a follow-up outside this deploy check and should not reopen release readiness without a new failing signal. | Keep scheduled/normal release regression evidence fresh before future deploys. | Ops/Release + QA/Test | 2026-05-14 |
| SOAR-DASHBOARD-001 | Dashboard Home | Selected-bot runtime truth, wallet KPIs, runtime positions/orders/trades tables | P0 | VERIFIED | High | Local proof covers loading, retryable error, selected-bot switching, wallet KPI recalculation, open-orders rows, trade-history rows, stale-row suppression, desktop/mobile empty/onboarding state, active PAPER runtime rows, wallet baseline/free funds, and Orders tab interaction. 2026-05-14 production evidence for deployed `457bce05` adds authenticated `/dashboard` route reachability plus simultaneous runtime readback where both Binance PAPER bots expose fresh `RUNNING` sessions, symbol stats, positions, trades, and aggregate data, while the controlled Binance LIVE observation window also proved runtime readback without order placement.

## Current Release Evidence Notes

- 2026-05-14
  `V1-PRODUCTION-FIXTURE-ACTION-PROOF-PLAN-2026-05-14` records the current
  literal-100% blocker for remaining `PASS_LOCAL` rows: production-safe
  action proofs need explicit owner approval before creating, editing, or
  deleting disposable production fixtures. The safe boundary is published at
  `docs/operations/v1-production-fixture-action-proof-plan-2026-05-14.md`.
  No module should be promoted from `PARTIAL`/`PASS_LOCAL` to `VERIFIED`/`PASS`
  from this plan alone; it only defines the approved path needed before the
  next proof run.
- 2026-05-14
  `V1-BACK-WEB-FULL-LOCAL-BASELINE-457BCE05-2026-05-14` applies broadly to the
  API/Web release surface: repository guardrails passed, API/Web typecheck
  passed, full Web Vitest passed (`149` files / `512` tests), full API Vitest
  passed, lint passed, production build passed, and `git diff --check` passed
  with line-ending warnings only. This strengthens local confidence for the
  implemented backend and web layers, but rows remain `PARTIAL` where their
  missing proof is explicitly production-safe clickthrough, external review, or
  protected operator evidence rather than local code coverage.
- 2026-05-14
  `V1-PROTECTED-OPS-GATE-457BCE05-2026-05-14` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001` and `SOAR-WORKERS-001`: production build-info is fresh
  for `457bce05338310c198c03a973395a9176f298dc1`, public API/Web smoke passes,
  protected runtime freshness passes, rollback proof passes with
  `shouldRollback=false`, authenticated production UI clickthrough passes, and
  controlled no-order-guard `LIVEIMPORT-03` readback passes for `TRXUSDT` with
  post-check deactivation. Activation audit/plan, RC external gates, RC
  sign-off, RC checklist, rollback proof, UI clickthrough, public smoke,
  protected smoke, runtime freshness, and rollback guard are fresh/pass for
  2026-05-14. Rows remain `PARTIAL`/production-blocked until the current-day
  production restore drill passes through an approved operator-safe path and
  the final target gate returns `ready`.
- 2026-05-14
  `V1-CURRENT-MAIN-PROMOTION-DEPLOY-LAG-457BCE05-2026-05-14` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`: current candidate
  `457bce05338310c198c03a973395a9176f298dc1` is pushed to
  `origin/codex/v1-proof-and-ops-evidence` and `origin/main`. Production
  build-info now reports `457bce05`, and public production smoke passed for
  that deployed surface. The row remains `PARTIAL` for current `main` until
  protected runtime freshness, alerts/rollback guard, and the target release
  gate are rerun with approved admin/ops access.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-RUNTIME-NON-BINANCE-DERIVATIVES-ADAPTER-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001` and `SOAR-EXCHANGE-ADAPTER-001`: runtime symbol-stats
  fallback derivatives and the live signal market-data gateway now use Exchange
  public adapter methods for non-Binance funding-rate history, open-interest
  history, and current order-book snapshots where supported. Binance REST
  remains scoped to Binance, unsupported adapter capabilities fail closed, and
  derivative fallback caches are exchange-scoped. Evidence: focused runtime
  tests passed (`26/26`), API typecheck passed, and repository guardrails
  passed. Rows remain `PARTIAL` because production-safe multi-bot/runtime
  clickthrough and real target-environment operation proof remain separate
  lanes.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-NON-BINANCE-BACKTEST-DERIVATIVES-ADAPTER-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-BACKTESTS-001` and `SOAR-EXCHANGE-ADAPTER-001`: non-Binance futures
  backtest supplemental funding-rate and open-interest history now flows
  through the Exchange public market-data adapter where CCXT exposes those
  public methods. The slice also adds an order-book snapshot boundary but keeps
  non-Binance backtest order-book history empty because a current snapshot is
  not valid historical input. CCXT public market-data normalization and client
  shape types were extracted out of the production connector to satisfy
  monolith guardrails. Evidence: focused backtest/exchange tests passed
  (`26/26`), API typecheck passed, and repository guardrails passed. Rows
  remain `PARTIAL` because runtime non-Binance derivative fallbacks and
  production-safe multi-bot/backtest clickthrough remain separate lanes.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-RUNTIME-TICKER-AND-BACKTEST-VENUE-UI-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`, `SOAR-BACKTESTS-001`, and
  `SOAR-EXCHANGE-ADAPTER-001`: generic runtime fallback ticker prices now use
  the Exchange public market-data boundary for Binance and non-Binance
  exchanges, runtime position readback requests fallback prices in the actual
  bot exchange context, and Backtest details renders resolved
  `exchange / marketType / baseCurrency`. Evidence: focused runtime tests
  passed (`36/36`), focused Backtest details Web test passed (`4/4`), and
  API/Web typechecks passed. Rows remain `PARTIAL` pending production-safe
  multi-bot/runtime/backtest clickthrough and generic non-Binance derivatives
  supplemental support.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-BOT-BACKTEST-EXCHANGE-ADAPTER-AUDIT-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-BACKTESTS-001`, `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`, and
  `SOAR-EXCHANGE-ADAPTER-001`: backtest candle loading and bot runtime
  fallback candles now route through the Exchange public market-data boundary
  with exact exchange context instead of direct Binance candle REST. Backtest
  run/timeline replay carries resolved exchange context, `MarketCandleCache`
  uniqueness includes `source`, and Web backtest timeline typing includes
  backend exchange/order-book/parity fields. Evidence: focused bot/backtest
  tests passed (`56/56`), API typecheck passed, and Web typecheck passed.
  Rows remain `PARTIAL` because production-safe multi-bot/runtime/backtest
  clickthrough and generic non-Binance derivatives supplemental support remain
  separate lanes.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-RUNTIME-EXCHANGE-ADAPTER-BOUNDARY-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-EXCHANGE-ADAPTER-001` and `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`: runtime candle
  warmup and indicator recovery now use the exchange-owned public market-data
  boundary instead of direct Binance REST from Engine. Runtime candle and
  derivative stores are exchange-scoped, strategy evaluation receives exchange
  context, and Binance-only derivative fallbacks fail closed for Gate.io.
  Evidence: focused runtime/decision-loop tests (`55/55`), exchange/stream/
  fallback/read-model tests (`12/12`), API typecheck, and guardrails passed.
  Rows remain `PARTIAL` because production-safe multi-bot/live runtime proof
  remains a separate lane.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-NON-GATEIO-RUNTIME-AND-APP-PROOF-00169D7F-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-BOTS-001`, `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`, `SOAR-DASHBOARD-001`,
  `SOAR-EXCHANGE-ADAPTER-001`, and `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`: Gate.io is
  deferred by user decision for this slice. Authenticated read-only production
  readback verifies both active Binance PAPER bots have fresh RUNNING runtime
  monitoring data through session detail, symbol stats, positions, trades, and
  aggregate monitoring endpoints. The Binance LIVE bot exists and has
  live opt-in enabled, but is currently inactive and has no RUNNING session.
  Local gates passed: focused Web runtime tests (`41/41`), focused API
  runtime/monitoring tests (`47/47` and `29/29`), typecheck, build,
  guardrails, and `test:go-live:smoke`. Rows remain `PARTIAL` where they
  require production action-level UI proof or current LIVE runtime activation
  evidence.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-PRODUCTION-RUNTIME-INVENTORY-00169D7F-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-BOTS-001` and `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`: authenticated read-only
  production inventory found 2 active PAPER bots and 1 inactive LIVE Binance
  futures bot. Latest PAPER sessions are RUNNING with fresh heartbeats; latest
  LIVE sessions are CANCELED. Production lacks the requested second active LIVE
  bot and has no visible LIVE Gate.io bot, so the local 2x PAPER + Binance LIVE
  + Gate.io LIVE proof shape cannot yet be claimed in production. Rows remain
  `PARTIAL`.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-PRODUCTION-UI-CLICKTHROUGH-REFRESH-00169D7F-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-BOTS-001`, `SOAR-UX-A11Y-MOBILE-001`, and
  `SOAR-SUBSCRIPTIONS-ADMIN-001`: authenticated production route/module
  reachability passed for deployed `00169d7f...` with public `PASS:4`,
  dashboard `PASS:18`, admin `PASS:3`, legacy `PASS:3`, and no blockers.
  Artifact scan found no raw credential/token/cookie/private-header values.
  Rows remain `PARTIAL` because this is GET-only protected route evidence; it
  does not prove every create/edit/delete/action journey or responsive browser
  rendering.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-WEB-BACKEND-PARITY-MONITORING-PROPS-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`: Bots Monitoring props now reuse shared runtime enum
  aliases for fee source and capital source, plus `BotRuntimeTrade["origin"]`
  for operational trade origin, removing a local prop-contract drift point.
  Evidence: focused `BotsManagement` test passed (`14/14`), Web typecheck
  passed, local duplicate-union scan returned no matches, and repository
  guardrails passed. The row remains `PARTIAL` pending production-safe
  clickthrough and broader V1 runtime proof.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-WEB-BACKEND-PARITY-RUNTIME-ENUMS-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-DASHBOARD-001` and `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`: Web runtime enum typing now
  reflects backend `FeeSource`, `TradingRecordOrigin`,
  `PositionManagementMode`, and runtime capital-source domains for runtime
  trade/order/position payloads. Stale Web fixtures using values the backend
  cannot emit were normalized. Evidence: focused Web runtime tests passed (`5`
  files, `47` tests), Web typecheck passed, stale-value scan returned no
  matches, and repository guardrails passed. Rows remain `PARTIAL` because
  production-safe clickthrough and the broader V1 route matrix are still
  separate lanes.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-WEB-BACKEND-PARITY-RUNTIME-ORIGIN-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-DASHBOARD-001` and `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`: Web runtime position origin
  typing now includes backend `USER`, and Dashboard Home maps backend
  `origin=USER` to the Manual source label in the edit-position context while
  keeping legacy `MANUAL` payload compatibility. Evidence: focused Web test
  passed (`3/3`) and Web typecheck passed. Rows remain `PARTIAL` because the
  broader V1 route matrix and production-safe clickthrough are not complete.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-WEB-BACKEND-PARITY-DASHBOARD-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-DASHBOARD-001` and `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`: Web runtime trade contract
  now matches backend nullable `orderId`, `positionId`, and `strategyId`;
  Bots Monitoring renders missing runtime relationship IDs as `-`; Web
  positions summary typing and empty API/Web aggregate payloads now carry
  `openPositionQty`. Evidence: Web focused tests passed (`2` files,
  `17` tests), API runtime monitoring aggregate e2e passed (`18/18`), API
  typecheck passed, and Web typecheck passed. Rows remain `PARTIAL` because the
  broader V1 route matrix and production-safe clickthrough are not complete.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-LIVE-PAPER-SIMULTANEOUS-RUNTIME-PROOF-00169D7F-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-BOTS-001`, `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`, and
  `SOAR-EXCHANGE-ADAPTER-001`: local DB-backed API/runtime evidence now proves
  two active PAPER bots plus active Binance LIVE and Gate.io LIVE bots can
  coexist while selected runtime position reads stay isolated by mode, wallet,
  API key, exchange, and market type. The slice also verifies venue-scoped LIVE
  overlap, Gate.io-safe runtime fallback market data through the exchange
  boundary, Binance-only derivative fallback degradation for Gate.io, duplicate
  guard regression, runtime PnL parity, API typecheck, and focused Dashboard
  Web rendering. A rendered Dashboard Home regression also proves all four
  bots appear in the selector and selected wallet/runtime rows re-scope when
  switching between PAPER, Binance LIVE, and Gate.io LIVE. At that checkpoint,
  production-safe authenticated UI/runtime clickthrough and real live
  multi-bot operation evidence were still separate V1 lanes.
- 2026-05-14
  `V1-LIVE-PAPER-SIMULTANEOUS-RUNTIME-PROOF-REFRESH-457BCE05-2026-05-14`
  refreshes the same `SOAR-BOTS-001`, `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001`, and
  `SOAR-EXCHANGE-ADAPTER-001` evidence after the production deploy of
  `457bce05`: production build-info passed for `457bce05`, focused API
  LIVE/PAPER isolation tests passed (`25/25`), focused Web Dashboard
  selected-bot/runtime tests passed (`24/24`), controlled no-order-guard
  production proof activated the existing Binance LIVE bot only for the
  observation window, `LIVEIMPORT-03` passed for `TRXUSDT`, simultaneous
  read-only runtime readback showed the Binance LIVE bot and both Binance
  PAPER bots RUNNING, and post-cleanup readback confirmed the LIVE bot was
  inactive again. This closes the current production non-Gate.io simultaneous
  LIVE/PAPER runtime scope. Rows that still require deeper per-module
  production UI/action clickthrough remain `PARTIAL`; Gate.io/second-LIVE
  production shape remains unavailable/deferred rather than hidden.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-TARGET-RELEASE-GATE-PASS-00169D7F-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`: final `LIVEIMPORT-03` passed for `TRXUSDT`, final
  preflight has no blockers, and the production target-only release gate is
  `ready` for deployed `00169d7f`. Production build-info freshness,
  post-deploy smoke, runtime freshness, and rollback guard passed. The
  remaining limitation is local-environment-only: full gate artifact
  `2026-05-13Tfinal-v1-gate` is `not_ready` because Docker Desktop was
  unavailable for local `test:go-live:smoke` after guardrails, typecheck, and
  build passed.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-CONTROLLED-LIVE-PROOF-ATTEMPT-00169D7F-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`: an approved controlled LIVE proof started a RUNNING
  session and cleaned up by deactivating the bot. Initial ETH/DOGE proof
  targeting was corrected after confirming the target bot's real managed
  symbol set; the accepted proof passed for `TRXUSDT`. A runner partial-update
  defect was fixed and production bot configuration was restored to inactive
  LIVE/import-capable state after proof.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-CONTROLLED-LIVE-PROOF-PREACTIVATION-00169D7F-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`: controlled LIVE proof preactivation confirms the
  no-order guard is fully active and the target LIVE bot is inactive and
  import-capable. The runner refused activation without explicit live-risk
  approval. Operations remains `BLOCKED`.
- 2026-05-13
  `V1-PROD-RESTORE-AND-LIVEIMPORT-TRUTH-00169D7F-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`: production restore drill is fresh `PASS`, while
  LIVEIMPORT is fresh `failed` because the existing LIVE Binance futures bot
  has no running session. Operations remains `BLOCKED`; final preflight now
  has only `evidence:liveImportReadback:failed` as the V1 blocker.
- 2026-05-13 `V1-PROTECTED-PROOF-REDUCTION-00169D7F-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`, `SOAR-BOTS-001`,
  `SOAR-UX-A11Y-MOBILE-001`, and `SOAR-SUBSCRIPTIONS-ADMIN-001`:
  authenticated production UI clickthrough is now fresh `PASS`, and production
  rollback proof is fresh `PASS`. LIVEIMPORT production readback auth succeeds
  and finds one LIVE Binance futures bot, but no running session exists, so
  Operations remains `BLOCKED` and V1 remains `NO-GO`. Final preflight blockers
  are reduced to production DB restore context, LIVEIMPORT runtime readback,
  and stale backup/restore drill evidence.
- 2026-05-13 `V1-GATE4-PATRYK-SIGNOFF-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`: Gate 4 is now approved with the user-authorized
  `Patryk` approver/owner fields, and final preflight reports RC evidence as
  fresh. Operations remains `BLOCKED` on protected technical proof and stale
  DB/rollback evidence.
- 2026-05-13 `V1-RC-CURRENT-BLOCKED-REFRESH-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`: RC external gates, sign-off, and checklist are fresh
  for 2026-05-13 but remain failed/blocked because Gate 4 approver fields are
  missing. Operations remains `BLOCKED`.
- 2026-05-13 `V1-PRODUCTION-ACTIVATION-REFRESH-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`: production activation audit and activation evidence
  plan are fresh `NO-GO` artifacts for 2026-05-13. This removes the activation
  stale classification from final preflight, but Operations remains `BLOCKED`
  until protected auth, DB restore context, RC approval, rollback proof,
  `LIVEIMPORT-03`, authenticated production UI clickthrough, and the final
  release gate are complete.
- 2026-05-13 `V1-OPERATOR-PACKET-CURRENT-DAY-REFRESH-00169D7F-2026-05-13`
  applies to `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`, `SOAR-BOTS-001`, and
  `SOAR-UX-A11Y-MOBILE-001`: the current operator unblock packet now points to
  2026-05-13 final preflight, protected input readiness, and production UI
  audit artifacts. It is a handoff only, not production proof; statuses remain
  unchanged until protected inputs produce PASS artifacts and the final release
  gate returns `ready`.
- 2026-05-13 `V1-CURRENT-DAY-BLOCKER-REFRESH-00169D7F-2026-05-13` applies to
  `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`, `SOAR-BOTS-001`, and
  `SOAR-UX-A11Y-MOBILE-001`: deployed build-info still matches
  `00169d7fdc3aff8317759137b05594b20e773c8e`, final preflight public smoke
  passes, and no protected input names were present in the current Codex
  shell. The fresh production UI audit is `BLOCKED_AUTH` with protected
  dashboard/admin/legacy routes failing closed to `/auth/login`; this is
  current blocker evidence, not accepted production UI proof. Operations stays
  `BLOCKED`, Bots stays `PARTIAL`, and production UX clickthrough remains
  missing until approved production app/admin auth and protected release inputs
  are available.
- 2026-05-12 `V1-PROTECTED-INPUT-READINESS-CURRENT-SWEEP-00169D7F-2026-05-12`
  applies to `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001` and `SOAR-BOTS-001`: the current no-secret
  env-name sweep found no matching `LIVEIMPORT_READBACK_*`,
  `ROLLBACK_GUARD_*`, `PROD_UI_AUDIT_*`, `PROD_UI_*`, `SOAR_PROD_*`,
  production DB check, RC, or Gate input families. No secret values were
  printed or stored. This keeps Operations `BLOCKED` and Bots `PARTIAL` until
  the operator packet is executed with approved protected inputs.
- 2026-05-12 `BOTMULTI-09-CONTAINMENT-SUPERSEDE-00169D7F-2026-05-12` applies
  to `SOAR-BOT-RUNTIME-001` and `SOAR-OPERATIONS-001`: the historical
  production promotion marker is closed as contained in the deployed V1 line,
  but production runtime verification is still not closed. Protected runtime
  readback remains in `LIVEIMPORT-03` and the final release gate.
- 2026-05-12 `PROD-UI-AUDIT-PLAN-SUPERSEDE-00169D7F-2026-05-12` applies to
  `SOAR-BOTS-001` and `SOAR-UX-A11Y-MOBILE-001`: the historical broad
  production UI audit plan is closed as superseded by the current
  `ops:ui:prod-clickthrough` release-gate lane. Production UI verification is
  still not closed; the final gate requires a fresh PASS
  `prod-ui-module-clickthrough-*` artifact with approved `PROD_UI_AUDIT_*`
  auth.

## Maintenance Rules

- Update this file when a feature ships, a bug is fixed, a regression appears,
  architecture changes, validation proves a journey, or a module is deferred.
- Prefer verification tasks before fix tasks when the only problem is missing
  evidence.
- Mark a journey `VERIFIED` only when evidence is current and reproducible.
- Mark a journey `BROKEN` when a real user journey fails, even if related tests
  pass.
- Link evidence to test names, commands, screenshots, smoke notes, commits, or
  task IDs. Chat-only evidence is not enough.
