## 1. Legacy Runtime Model (What It Actually Does)

### 1.1 `positions.service.js`

Core responsibility:
- Fetch open positions from exchange.
- Cache positions for 10 seconds.
- Run lifecycle checks in strict order for each position.

Key runtime order inside `checkPositions()`:
1. `handleDCA(position, closePosition)`
2. `handleTP(position, closePosition)`
3. `handleTTP(position, closePosition)`
4. `handleSL(position, closePosition)`
5. `handleTSL(position, closePosition)`

Important side effects:
- On `openPosition()`:
  - rejects if max open positions reached,
  - rejects if same symbol already open,
  - clears per-symbol runtime state:
    - `clearDCA(symbol)`
    - `clearTSL(symbol)`
    - `clearTTP(symbol)`
- On `closePosition()`:
  - submits opposite market order,
  - clears the same runtime state buckets.

### 1.2 `dca.service.js`

State:
- `dcaHistory[symbol]` = number of successful DCA executions for symbol.

Trigger logic:
- Active only if `dca.enabled`.
- Stops when `dcaHistory[symbol] >= dca.times`.
- Uses threshold by current DCA index:
  - `percent = dca.percents[dcaHistory[symbol]] || -40`
- Trigger condition:
  - `profitPercent < percent` (strictly less than).

Execution:
- Order size: `amount * dca.multiplier`.
- Increments `dcaHistory[symbol]` only after successful order.

### 1.3 `tp.service.js`

Trigger:
- If `tp.enabled` and `profitPercent >= tp.percent`.

Action:
- Immediate close by market order.

Position in sequence:
- Runs before `TTP/SL/TSL`.

### 1.4 `ttp.service.js`

State:
- `ttpTracking[symbol] = { highProfit, step }`.

Dynamic regime:
- Chooses active start/step from arrays (`starts[]`, `steps[]`) based on current `profitPercent`.

Lifecycle:
- Activate tracking when `profitPercent >= start`.
- Raise high watermark when profit grows.
- Close when retrace condition is met:
  - `profitPercent <= highProfit - step`.

### 1.5 `sl.service.js`

Intended trigger:
- Enabled only after all DCA levels are completed:
  - `dcaCount == dca.times`.
- Then hard SL level from entry:
  - Long: `entry * (1 - sl%)`
  - Short: `entry * (1 + sl%)`

Note:
- File contains a bug in symbol usage order (`symbol` referenced before destructuring), but intended business rule is clear: SL is DCA-gated.

### 1.6 `tsl.service.js`

State:
- `tslTracking[symbol] = { maxLoss }`.

Activation:
- Requires `dcaCount == dca.times`.
- Starts at configured negative band (`tsl.start`), then trails upward by `tsl.step`.

Behavior:
- When rebound improves, `maxLoss` is raised.
- If profit falls below `maxLoss`, position closes.

Interaction with TTP:
- When TTP tracking is active, TSL tracker is cleared to avoid double-trailing conflict.

### 1.7 `risk.service.js`

Entry sizing:
- Uses wallet balance and `risk.perTrade`.
- Applies leverage.
- Caps effective exposure by available balance.
- Applies exchange constraints:
  - `stepSize`,
  - `minNotional`.

### 1.8 Function-by-function map (legacy)

## 2. Legacy Sequence Contract (Critical)

Legacy intent is sequence-first:
- DCA is always evaluated first.
- Close logic is evaluated after DCA.
- State transitions in earlier steps affect later steps in the same cycle.

This is the root reason why parity cannot be achieved with independent per-feature evaluators in different modules.

---

## 3. CryptoSparrow Canonical Contract (Parity + Clarification)

For CryptoSparrow, we keep the legacy sequencing discipline but formalize one additional rule required by product behavior:

### 3.1 One shared lifecycle algorithm for all modes

`BACKTEST`, `PAPER`, `LIVE` must use the same lifecycle decision core:
- same inputs,
- same ordering,
- same close reasons,
- same state transitions.

Only data adapters differ:
- historical candles for backtest,
- stream/mark prices for paper/live.

### 3.2 Mandatory evaluation order per position, per cycle

1. Entry/hold/exit signal context (strategy)
2. DCA phase
3. Close phase
  - basic mode: `TP -> SL`
  - advanced mode: `TTP -> TSL`
4. Liquidation guard / hard account floor

### 3.3 DCA-first close guard (required)

If position has pending DCA levels and DCA is still financially possible:
- do not close by `TTP`, `TSL`, or `SL` yet.

Exception:
- if next DCA cannot be funded (no free margin/wallet), close protections are allowed.

This rule prevents early close before planned averaging sequence is exhausted.

### 3.4 Symbol constraints

- One active position per symbol.
- No flip while position is open.
- New opposite position can open only after previous one is closed.

### 3.5 State reset contract

On open and on close:
- clear DCA state,
- clear TTP state,
- clear TSL state.

## 4. Known Legacy Gaps to Avoid Copying Blindly

- `sl.service.js` has a symbol-scoping bug.
- DCA funds check in legacy uses coarse balance logic and does not model margin reservation rigorously.
- Legacy module has duplicated close-side exchange calls in different services.

CryptoSparrow must keep behavioral intent, not copy implementation defects.

## 5. Documentation Binding

The following docs are normative with this analysis:
- [Position Lifecycle Parity Matrix](./position-lifecycle-parity-matrix.md)
- [Trading Logic](./trading-logic.md)

Any lifecycle change must update all three documents in the same PR.
