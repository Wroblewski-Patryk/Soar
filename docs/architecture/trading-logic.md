# Trading Logic

## Current State
- Strategy and market/bot configuration layers are available.
- Orders include read and write-side lifecycle actions (`open`/`cancel`/`close`) with risk guards.
- Exchange connector services and runtime execution orchestrator are available with smoke-tested signal -> order -> position flow.
- Dashboard has a live market bar UI ready for SSE market stream events.
- Server-owned SSE fan-out is wired and runtime signal automation is active in worker execution flow.
- Runtime management covers SL/TP/trailing/DCA automation and periodic market/position scan re-evaluation.

## Strategy Builder Requirements (MVP)
- Rule-based builder (list of conditions).
- Visual editor (drag-and-drop) for composing rules.
- Indicators: must support a wide set of standard indicators.
- Logic: AND/OR groups and comparisons.
- Multi-timeframe: strategy can reference multiple timeframes.
- Multiple entry and exit rules.
- Risk controls: TP, SL, trailing, leverage, position sizing rules.
- Strategy presets (trend, mean reversion, breakout, etc.).
- Export-ready JSON structure (versioning planned after MVP).

## Strategy Builder (Planned)
- Node-based builder (graph style) as an advanced mode.
- Nested condition groups beyond simple AND/OR lists.

## Order Types (MVP)
- Market
- Limit
- Stop
- Stop-limit
- Take-profit
- Trailing

## Position Sizing (MVP)
- Fixed amount.
- Percentage of balance.
- Risk-based sizing (per trade).

## Leverage Strategy (Recommendation)
- Set leverage per strategy (default) for clarity and safety.
- Allow per-position override later if needed.

## Market Universe and Symbols
- Bots operate on a market universe built from a base currency (for example USDT).
- The universe can be filtered by rules (for example volume thresholds).
- Users can create named symbol groups from the filtered universe.
- Users can whitelist or blacklist symbols.
- Canonical symbol composition formula is: `final = unique(filter_result U whitelist) - blacklist`.
- `filter_result` exists only when the min-quote-volume filter is enabled.
- If filter is disabled and whitelist is empty, result is empty (no implicit all-symbol fallback).
- Blacklist-only input does not add symbols by itself.
- Stable-to-stable pairs (for example USDT/USDC) should be auto-excluded by default.
- Manual overrides must always be possible for exclusions and inclusions.
- Each bot can trade multiple symbols and multiple strategies mapped to symbol groups.
- Binding model: BotStrategy binds one strategy to one symbol group for a given bot; multiple bindings per bot are supported.

## Position Rules
- At most one open position per symbol at a time.
- Total concurrent positions are capped by a user-defined max.
- Each position belongs to a specific strategy.
- No flip on symbol while position is open (opposite side may open only after close).

## Risk Management (MVP)
- Max open positions (per user or per bot).
- TP and SL defined by the strategy that opens the position.
- Trailing stop: percentage or fixed levels.
- DCA: add to position on positive or negative conditions.
- DCA-first guard: if DCA levels are still pending and affordable, do not close by TTP/TSL/SL yet.
- DCA affordability exception: when next DCA is not affordable, TTP/TSL/SL may execute for protection.

## Risk Management (Planned)
- Trailing based on volatility or ATR.

## Data Sources
- MVP live path target: WebSocket stream for live prices/candles.
- MVP historical/fallback path: REST OHLCV ingestion.
- Planned: order book, funding, open interest.

## Target Flow
1. Fetch market data and build OHLCV candles.
2. Compute indicators per strategy interval.
3. Evaluate strategy rules and produce signals.
4. Run pre-trade analysis before opening a position.
5. Execute orders with configured risk parameters.
6. Track and update positions with TP, SL, trailing, and DCA logic.
7. Log all decisions and outcomes for audit.

## Execution Modes
- Backtest. Historical simulation with trade list and chart overlays.
- Paper. Live data and simulated execution with fees and slippage.
- Live. Real exchange execution via API.
- Local-only. Self-hosted execution for a single owner.
- Backtest, paper, and live must use one shared lifecycle decision algorithm (same order and reasons), with only data/execution adapters differing.

## Re-entry Rules
- New positions open only after a fresh signal and analysis pass.

## Backtesting Rules (MVP)
- Must include fees, slippage, and funding.
- Must calculate profit, loss, drawdown, and trade-level PnL.
- Must produce a summary report from the same data that powers live stats.
- New run creation uses explicit selected time window (`startAt/endAt`) as the
  primary candle-range source; legacy runs without range fields remain readable
  through fallback timeline anchoring.
- Timeline data for charting is exposed in chunks (cursor + chunk size) so UI can stream large symbol sets without blocking.
- Backtest chart overlays are built from:
  - candle series (OHLCV),
  - strategy indicators (price panel + oscillator panel),
  - position lifecycle events (ENTRY/EXIT in MVP, DCA/TP/SL planned).
- Event parity rule: markers/counters must come from lifecycle events generated by the shared engine, never from UI-only heuristics.

## Lifecycle Order Contract
- Canonical sequence per position cycle:
  1. DCA
  2. Close phase by mode:
     - basic: TP -> SL
     - advanced: TTP -> TSL
  3. Liquidation/account-floor protections
