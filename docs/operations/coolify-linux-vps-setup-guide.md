# Coolify Linux VPS Setup Guide (Service Mapping + Domains)

Date: 2026-04-03  
Owner: Ops + Release Engineering  
Scope: `DPL-03`

## Purpose
Provide one repeatable setup path for hosting CryptoSparrow on a Linux VPS with Coolify, including:
- service split (`postgres`, `redis`, `api`, `web`, `workers`),
- domain routing,
- deployment checks.

This guide is for STAGE and PROD environments.

## Target Topology

For each environment (`stage` and `prod`) deploy:
1. Postgres service
2. Redis service
3. API service (`apps/api`)
4. Web service (`apps/web`)
5. Workers service (`apps/api` workers)

Do not run workers inside API process in VPS deployment.
Deployed worker ownership contract:
- canonical healthy state = split workers
- inline worker ownership is not a normal VPS topology
- if inline is ever used as an emergency fallback, treat the environment as
  degraded until split ownership is restored

## Domain Routing Contract

Production:
- Web: `soar.luckysparrow.ch`
- API: `api.soar.luckysparrow.ch`

Stage (recommended pattern):
- Web: `stage-soar.luckysparrow.ch`
- API: `stage-api.soar.luckysparrow.ch`

## Prerequisites

On VPS host:
- Docker Engine installed
- Coolify installed and reachable
- DNS records prepared for web/api domains
- Firewall open for HTTPS (`443`) and Coolify access path

Repository requirements:
- monorepo available to Coolify
- lockfile present (`pnpm-lock.yaml`)

## Step 1: Create Coolify Project and Environment

1. In Coolify, create project: `cryptosparrow`.
2. Create environment:
   - `stage` (first),
   - `prod` (after stage validation).
3. Keep stage and prod resources separate.

## Step 2: Provision Data Services

### Postgres
- Add managed Postgres service.
- Persistent volume required.
- Set database name/user/password.
- Capture internal connection string for app services.

### Redis
- Add managed Redis service.
- Persistent volume recommended.
- Capture internal connection string.

## Step 3: Add API Service (`apps/api`)

Docker build configuration (Coolify):
- Source: repository root (monorepo)
- Build pack: `Dockerfile`
- Docker build context: repository root (`.`)
- Dockerfile location: `apps/api/Dockerfile`
- Exposed port: `3001`

Runtime command:
- keep image default command (`node scripts/start-with-migrate.mjs`)
- startup behavior:
  1. run `prisma migrate deploy`,
  2. start API only if migrations succeed.

Health checks:
- `/health`
- `/ready`

Required environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL=<coolify-postgres-url>`
- `REDIS_URL=<coolify-redis-url>`
- `SERVER_URL=https://api.<env-domain>`
- `CLIENT_URL=https://<web-env-domain>`
- `CORS_ORIGINS=https://<web-env-domain>`
- `JWT_SECRET=<secret>`
- `COOKIE_DOMAIN=<shared-parent-domain>` (optional, for shared subdomain sessions, e.g. `luckysparrow.ch`)
- `COOKIE_SAME_SITE=<lax|strict|none>` (optional, default `lax`; use `none` only when web/api are cross-site)
- `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEYS=<versioned-keys>`
- `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_ACTIVE_VERSION=<active-version>`
- `COINGECKO_API_BASE_URL=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3`
- `COIN_ICON_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=360` (recommended baseline; tune per traffic profile)

Optional but recommended in STAGE/PROD:
- `COINGECKO_API_KEY=<secret>`

Optional migration toggle:
- `API_AUTO_MIGRATE=true` (default behavior in API image)
- set `API_AUTO_MIGRATE=false` only for emergency/maintenance windows

## Step 4: Add Web Service (`apps/web`)

Docker build configuration (Coolify):
- Source: repository root (monorepo)
- Build pack: `Dockerfile`
- Docker build context: repository root (`.`)
- Dockerfile location: `apps/web/Dockerfile`
- Exposed port: `3002`

Runtime command:
- keep image default command (`pnpm --filter web start`)

Required environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.<env-domain>`

## Step 5: Add Workers Service

Create dedicated worker services from the same API image.
Process ownership contract: `api` does not own worker lifecycle in production.

For deterministic production behavior create separate services:
- `workers-market-data`
- `workers-market-stream`
- `workers-backtest`
- `workers-execution`

Each worker service config:
- Build pack: `Dockerfile`
- Docker build context: repository root (`.`)
- Dockerfile location:
  - `workers-market-data` -> `apps/api/Dockerfile.worker.market-data`
  - `workers-market-stream` -> `apps/api/Dockerfile.worker.market-stream`
  - `workers-backtest` -> `apps/api/Dockerfile.worker.backtest`
  - `workers-execution` -> `apps/api/Dockerfile.worker.execution`
- Exposed port: none

Shared worker env:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL=<coolify-postgres-url>`
- `REDIS_URL=<coolify-redis-url>`
- runtime/queue keys required by current worker contract (`WORKER_*`, selected `RUNTIME_*`)

Operational rule:
- a deployment is not considered topology-complete unless the split worker
  services are present and healthy

## Step 6: Attach Domains and TLS

1. Attach web domain to web service.
2. Attach api domain to api service.
3. Enable managed TLS in Coolify.
4. Verify certificates issued and routing healthy.

## Step 6A: Reverse-Proxy Cache Rules (Critical)

Cache policy must be fail-closed for authenticated/runtime surfaces.

Never cache (reverse proxy, CDN, edge):
- `/auth/*`
- `/dashboard/*`
- `/admin/*`
- API responses containing `Set-Cookie`
- SSE/event streams (`/dashboard/market-stream/*`)

Allowed cache scope (static only):
- `/_next/static/*`
- `/icons/*`
- immutable static assets (`*.js`, `*.css`, `*.png`, `*.svg`, `*.webp`, `*.woff2`, etc.)

Operational rules:
1. Respect origin `Cache-Control` headers from API (especially `no-store` on sensitive namespaces).
2. Do not override `no-store` with proxy defaults.
3. Do not enable HTML/document caching for dashboard/auth/admin pages.
4. Keep service-worker caching aligned to static-only contract (no runtime/API payload caching).

Quick verification checklist:
1. `curl -I https://api.<env-domain>/auth/me` should include `Cache-Control: no-store...`
2. `curl -I https://api.<env-domain>/dashboard` should include `Cache-Control: no-store...`
3. `curl -I https://api.<env-domain>/admin` should include `Cache-Control: no-store...`
4. `curl -I https://<web-env-domain>/_next/static/...` should be cacheable (`public, max-age` or equivalent immutable policy)
5. Dashboard runtime data should update after hard refresh without stale payload replay.

## Step 7: Migrations Before Go-Live

Before first stage/prod release:
1. Run DB migration job against target DB.
2. Confirm Prisma schema is up to date.
3. Confirm API starts without migration drift errors.

If migration fails, do not continue deployment.

Note:
- API startup runs `prisma migrate deploy` automatically (safe/idempotent path).
- Do **not** use destructive commands like `prisma migrate reset` or reseeding in production.

## Step 8: Stage Validation Gate

After STAGE deploy:
1. `GET /health` -> `200`
2. `GET /ready` -> `200`
3. Open stage web URL and login flow.
4. Validate dashboard base data load.
5. Validate workers heartbeat and runtime update path.
6. Validate icon lookup endpoint for deterministic fallback behavior:
   - `GET /dashboard/icons/lookup?symbols=BTCUSDT,UNKNOWNXYZ`
   - verify response includes both `source: "coingecko"` and `source: "placeholder"` contracts when expected.

Only promote same commit SHA to PROD after full pass.

## Step 9: Production Rollout

1. Promote immutable SHA from STAGE to PROD.
2. Run same health checks.
3. Run smoke checks from runbook:
   - `docs/operations/v1-ops-runbook.md`
4. Record deployment evidence.

## Rollback Baseline

If post-deploy health fails:
1. Roll back API/Web to previous stable release.
2. Keep DB safety in mind (prefer backward-compatible migrations).
3. Re-validate `/health` and `/ready`.
4. Log incident and rollback reason.

## Common Failure Points

1. Wrong `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` -> web cannot reach API.
2. Stage using prod DB/Redis by mistake.
3. Missing worker service -> runtime data stale.
4. Wrong/missing cookie session config (`COOKIE_DOMAIN`, `COOKIE_SAME_SITE`) for deployed domains.
5. API CORS not matching web domain.
6. Wrong Dockerfile path in Coolify (must point to `apps/api/Dockerfile` or `apps/web/Dockerfile`).
7. Using Docker mode without repository Dockerfile artifacts.
8. Coolify build-secrets injection + old Dockerfile frontend (`1.7`) can fail with `unexpected key 'env' in 'env=COOLIFY_URL'`; keep deploy Dockerfiles on `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.10` or newer.
