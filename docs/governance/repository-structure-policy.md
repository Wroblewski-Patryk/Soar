# Repository Structure Policy

## Purpose
Define how files are placed in this repository to keep navigation predictable and avoid documentation drift.

## Root Minimalism Rules
Only true repository-level files stay in root:
- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `LICENSE` (if present)

Domain, planning, architecture, and operational docs must not be placed in root.

## Documentation Placement Rules
All domain documentation belongs under `docs/` using the category folders:
- `architecture/`
- `engineering/`
- `planning/`
- `product/`
- `operations/`
- `security/`
- `ux/`
- `governance/`
- `adr/`
- `modules/`

`docs/README.md` is the canonical index and must be updated whenever files are moved or renamed.

## Migration Rules for Root Docs
When a non-repo markdown file appears in root:
1. Move it into the correct `docs/` category.
2. Update references in all markdown files.
3. Record the mapping (`old -> new`) in the change report or changelog.
4. Do not delete content unless it is duplicated and already preserved in canonical docs.

## Cross-Project Isolation Rules
- Do not use sibling-repository references.
- Do not use absolute local machine paths.
- Do not use unresolved template shortcuts such as unresolved template shortcut markers.
- Use repository-relative links only.

## Link and Integrity Rules
- No broken internal links after any doc migration.
- Keep content in English.
- Preserve project assumptions, decisions, and historical notes when restructuring.

## Evidence and Artifact Naming

- Prefer `kebab-case` for markdown docs.
- Suffix historical evidence docs with an ISO date: `-YYYY-MM-DD`.
- If evidence maps to a specific deploy boundary, include a short commit SHA in
  the filename: `-<sha7>`.
- Store generated outputs (JSON, logs, screenshots, exports) under the
  appropriate domain folder (usually `docs/operations/` or `docs/planning/`).
- Prefix generated artifacts with `_artifacts-` to keep them visibly
  non-canonical and easy to filter.
- Include enough context to disambiguate environment and command intent (for
  example: `prod`, `staging`, `local`, `vps`).

## Canonical Planning Paths
- `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- `docs/planning/v1-live-release-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/open-decisions.md`
- `docs/planning/repo-migration-plan.md`
- `docs/planning/mobile-parity-contract.md`

## App Folder Naming Policy
- Current runtime naming in repository: `apps/web`, `apps/api`.
- Target naming after staged migration: `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `apps/mobile`.
- Migration must follow non-breaking staged rollout from `docs/planning/repo-migration-plan.md`.

## Mobile Bootstrap Policy
- `apps/mobile` may exist as scaffold before implementation starts.
- Bootstrap-only mobile folders must not claim production readiness.
- Full mobile delivery starts only after parity gates defined in `docs/planning/mobile-parity-contract.md`.
