# CPU/DB Optimization Commit Plan (2026-04-06)

Status: closed (2026-04-16, historical reference)  
Owner: API + Web + Ops  
Scope: runtime CPU hot path, DB pressure, dashboard polling pressure, worker scalability.

## Execution protocol (for next AI executor)

1. Trigger phrase: user says `zrob nastepna grupe zadan`.
2. Pick first unchecked group from `## GROUPS`.
3. Execute commits from that group in order, one commit at a time (no mixed commits).
4. After each commit:
   - run targeted tests listed in commit item,
   - update this file (checkbox + short progress note),
   - keep changes tiny and reversible.
5. Stop after whole group is done and report:
   - files changed,
   - tests run,
   - risk notes,
   - next unchecked group.

## Guardrails

- No behavior drift in trading decisions, order lifecycle, or API contracts.
- Prefer feature flags for risky runtime-path changes.
- For cache-based optimizations: parity tests before and after optimization.
- No broad refactors outside listed files.

## Target outcomes (acceptance)

- Reduce DB reads on final-candle processing path by at least 40%.
- Reduce runtime telemetry writes (`touchSession` + stat upserts) by at least 60% during active sessions.
- Reduce dashboard/bots monitoring polling DB load by at least 35%.
- Keep decision parity (same OPEN/DCA/CLOSE outcomes on regression suite).

## Progress log

- 2026-04-06: Plan created. No implementation started yet.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-01` by locking runtime optimization feature-flag matrix and rollout/rollback guardrails in canonical governance docs (`open-decisions`, `working-agreements`).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-02` by introducing runtime hot-path metrics instrumentation (`listActiveBots`, `eligibleGroupsCount`, `preTradeLatencyMs`, `touchSessionWrites`, `symbolStatsWrites`) across runtime signal loop, pre-trade path, telemetry writes, and `/metrics` snapshot contract.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-03` by adding regression tests for hot-path metric emission in runtime signal loop, pre-trade analysis, telemetry writes, and metrics endpoint contract without changing decision behavior.
- 2026-04-16: Closed Group 1 (`CPDB-01..CPDB-03`). Next unchecked group is Group 2 (`CPDB-04..CPDB-06`).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-04` by adding runtime topology cache service with TTL (`RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_CACHE_TTL_MS`), feature-flag gate (`RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_CACHE_ENABLED`), topology-version invalidation based on bot/group/strategy graph updates, and runtime loop invalidation hooks on stop/stall.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-05` by switching final-candle topology reads to cache-backed path (`listActiveBotsFromTopologyCache`) with fail-safe fallback to direct query on cache read errors.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-06` by adding parity regression coverage for topology cache hit path, cache-failure direct-query fallback path, and invalidation-driven topology refresh behavior in runtime final-candle flow.
- 2026-04-16: Closed Group 2 (`CPDB-04..CPDB-06`). Next unchecked group is Group 3 (`CPDB-07..CPDB-09`).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-07` by adding a cache-refresh-bound routing index (`exchange|marketType|symbol|interval`) with wildcard-aware route resolution and deduped group targeting so final-candle evaluation processes only eligible bot market-groups, plus routing-index invalidation on stop/stall topology resets.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-08` by introducing short-TTL pre-trade open-position count caches (user-level and bot-level) and wiring deterministic invalidation on runtime execution `OPEN`/`CLOSE` outcomes to prevent stale risk-cap decisions while cutting repeat count reads.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-09` by adding pre-trade parity tests for count-cache reuse and explicit invalidation refresh so user/bot risk caps remain enforced while DB roundtrips are reduced.
- 2026-04-16: Closed Group 3 (`CPDB-07..CPDB-09`). Next unchecked group is Group 4 (`CPDB-10..CPDB-12`).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-10` by adding throttled `touchSession` heartbeat writes (`RUNTIME_TELEMETRY_TOUCH_SESSION_THROTTLE_MS`, default 15s), debounced symbol-stat batching (`RUNTIME_TELEMETRY_SYMBOL_STAT_DEBOUNCE_MS`, default 250ms), and session-close flush logic for pending stat updates.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-11` by passing `strategyLeverage` from runtime decision context into execution orchestration and deleting per-OPEN strategy leverage lookup query from orchestrator path.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-12` by adding query-count regression assertions that lock telemetry batching/throttling write reduction (`upsert` and `touchSession` call counts) and execution-path read reduction (no per-OPEN strategy leverage lookup query).
- 2026-04-16: Closed Group 4 (`CPDB-10..CPDB-12`). Next unchecked group is Group 5 (`CPDB-13..CPDB-15`).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-13` by replacing fixed 5s refresh loops with visibility-aware intervals (10s when tab is visible, 30s when hidden) in dashboard-home and bots monitoring runtime controllers, with updated web tests covering new cadence expectations.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-14` by moving dashboard-home and bots monitoring runtime refresh to SSE-first flow (`ticker`-driven silent refresh with visibility-aware throttling), while keeping interval polling only as fallback when stream is unavailable/disconnected/stale.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-15` by extending web regression coverage for runtime refresh cadence and stale recovery: hidden-tab 30s interval switch assertion on home dashboard plus SSE-tick refresh and stale-stream polling fallback assertions on bots monitoring.
- 2026-04-16: Closed Group 5 (`CPDB-13..CPDB-15`). Next unchecked group is Group 6 (`CPDB-16..CPDB-18`).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-16` by adding hot-path composite indexes for runtime position queries (`Position(userId, botId, status)` and `Position(userId, symbol, status)`) with migration `20260416005358_add_position_runtime_hot_path_indexes`; `bots/runtime` test sweep was executed and reached an existing unhandled Prisma FK rejection in runtime telemetry tests after all test assertions passed.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-17` by slimming active runtime topology read selection to only fields consumed by runtime signal evaluation/routing (bot market-groups, symbol-group universe filters, and strategy routing parameters), reducing payload size of `listActiveRuntimeBotsRaw` while preserving runtime loop behavior (`runtimeSignalLoop` tests green).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-18` by capturing `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON)` baseline/after snapshots for runtime position hot-path queries with index drop/recreate cycle, saving raw evidence to `docs/planning/_artifacts-cpdb18-explain-2026-04-16.json` and publishing summary in `cpu-db-explain-baseline-2026-04-06.md`.
- 2026-04-16: Closed Group 6 (`CPDB-16..CPDB-18`). Next unchecked group is Group 7 (`CPDB-19..CPDB-21`).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-19` by adding per-series final-candle backpressure guardrails in runtime loop (`exchange|marketType|symbol|interval` queue with bounded pending backlog + overflow drop of oldest pending event), while preserving sequential in-series processing semantics and queue cleanup on stop/stall; validated with `pnpm --filter api test -- runtimeSignalLoop` (PASS).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-20` by adding distributed warmup-lock plumbing for runtime candle series (`RuntimeSignalMarketDataGateway` lock hook + runtime-loop dependency wiring + Redis-backed lock acquisition/release in market-stream fanout), ensuring per-series warmup fetch coordination across replicas while failing open on Redis issues; validated with `pnpm --filter api test -- runtimeSignalLoop marketStream runtimeSignalMarketDataGateway` (PASS).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-21` by adding shared-series stress regression (`5 users x 3 bots`, `BTCUSDT/5m`) that validates duplicate-event idempotency in runtime side effects, plus new `marketStreamFanout` unit coverage for single-delivery payload fanout and warmup-lock NX/PX semantics; validated with `pnpm --filter api test -- runtimeSignalLoop marketStreamFanout` (PASS).
- 2026-04-16: Closed Group 7 (`CPDB-19..CPDB-21`). Next unchecked group is Group 8 (`CPDB-22..CPDB-24`).
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-22` by publishing staged flag rollout runbook and rollback matrix in canonical governance/planning docs (`working-agreements`, `v1-live-release-plan`), leaving `CPDB-23..CPDB-24` as remaining Group 8 scope.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-23` by locking CPU/DB alert-threshold and dashboard contract in `open-decisions` (API latency p95, DB QPS, runtime lag, restart bursts), with explicit source mapping and rollout-blocking fallback policy for missing local metrics; `deploy/monitoring` config directories are currently absent in repository scope.
- 2026-04-16: Completed `CPDB-24` by executing a 30-minute local soak run against `http://localhost:3001` (`/health`, concurrency 20) and publishing evidence artifacts (`docs/operations/_artifacts-cpdb24-soak-2026-04-16T02-03-29-605Z.json`, `docs/operations/cpdb24-soak-report-2026-04-16T02-03-29-605Z.md`) with pre/post metrics snapshot and `FAIL` conclusion (load-test summary overflow after run, with raw evidence preserved).
- 2026-04-16: Closed Group 8 (`CPDB-22..CPDB-24`). CPU/DB optimization execution plan is fully completed; next active group continues in canonical queue (`WLT-A` in `mvp-next-commits`).
