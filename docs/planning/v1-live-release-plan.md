# V1.0 Official Live Plan (World-Ready)

Goal: move from MVP to a production-grade public release (V1.0) with reliable live trading.

## Governance
- This file is the source of truth for post-MVP delivery.
- New requirements: update product/architecture/security docs first, then this plan.
- Keep tiny commits and explicit progress notes.

## Canonical Queue Linkage
- Canonical queue owner for final V1 closure wave: `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md` (`OPV-A`, closed).
- Canonical phase owner: `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md` (`OPV-01..OPV-04`).
- Runtime/product implementation waves and production sign-off synchronization are closed.

## Current Status (2026-04-20)
- Implementation and evidence track are complete across Phases A-F.
- Final production exit-gate snapshot is `G1=PASS`, `G2=PASS`, `G3=PASS`, `G4=PASS` (closure run: `2026-04-19T15:13:58.943Z`).
- Scope note (2026-03-22): unresolved admin+billing implementation items are explicitly moved to post-MVP/V1.1; V1 focuses on runtime/live-trading integrity and truthful release evidence.

## V1.0 Definition

#### CPU/DB Rollback Matrix (first action)
| Symptom | Immediate rollback |
| --- | --- |
| runtime signal-loop CPU spike or p95 decision latency regression | disable `RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_CACHE_ENABLED` |
| runtime session/stat write pressure on DB | disable `RUNTIME_TELEMETRY_THROTTLE_ENABLED` |
| dashboard API read surge after cadence switch | disable `WEB_RUNTIME_ADAPTIVE_POLLING_ENABLED` |
| dashboard runtime-card staleness or reconnect churn | disable `WEB_RUNTIME_SSE_PREFERRED_ENABLED` |

## Progress Log
- 2026-04-19: Executed OPV production refresh evidence pack (`OPV-02..OPV-03`) and synchronized RC artifacts (`v1-rc-external-gates-status.md`, `v1-rc-signoff-record.md`, `v1-release-candidate-checklist.md`) with fresh SLO observation + rolling window reports (`v1-slo-observation-2026-04-19T01-35-51-340Z.md`, `v1-slo-window-report-7d-2026-04-19T01-36-24-775Z.md`, `v1-slo-window-report-30d-2026-04-19T01-36-25-355Z.md`); Gate 2 remains `OPEN` pending VPS private-route/admin-auth worker probe closure.
- 2026-04-17: Closed lingering `Worker Split Timing` open decision in canonical governance (`docs/planning/open-decisions.md`) by locking `PROD` mandatory API/worker split-process policy and explicit `STAGE/DEV` split trigger thresholds (execution queue lag, API p95 + lag coupling, restart burst) with deployment/SLO/incident runbook references.
- 2026-04-16: Added `CPDB-22` runbook guardrails in V1 live plan with staged CPU/DB flag enable sequence (stage -> canary -> full) and explicit rollback matrix for runtime CPU/DB and dashboard refresh regressions.
- 2026-04-10: Closed V1 external production gates end-to-end: collected 30-minute production SLO window from VPS/private ops network path (`history/artifacts/_artifacts-slo-window-2026-04-10T17-09-26-532Z.json`, `history/evidence/v1-slo-observation-2026-04-10T17-09-26-532Z.md`), completed Gate1/Gate3 runbook evidence, finalized RC sign-off record, and reached strict production evidence check PASS (`G1/G2/G3/G4 = PASS`).
- 2026-04-07: Added explicit production prerequisites (target API + admin JWT + `PROD_DB_CHECK_*`) and one-command production closure instructions in RC runbook/checklist for final exit-gate execution.
- 2026-04-07: Added db-profile aware external-gates pipeline (`--db-profile`) and corrected strict production aliases so production closure commands enforce both `environment=production` and `db-profile=prod`.

- 2026-04-07: Synced RC external-gates status handoff template command so Gate2 collector instructions consistently require `--environment production`.
- 2026-04-07: Added production-only strict external-gates shortcuts (`ops:rc:gates:local-pipeline:strict:prod`, `ops:rc:gates:refresh:strict:prod`, `ops:rc:gates:refresh:summary:strict:prod`) to enforce Gate2 `PASS` policy during final release closure runs.
- 2026-04-07: Hardened production-evidence integrity for Exit Workpack by blocking `ops:slo:collect --environment production` on localhost/private hosts unless explicit `--allow-local-production-evidence` dry-run override is provided.
- 2026-04-10: Collected first production SLO observation artifact (`history/evidence/v1-slo-observation-2026-04-10T15-03-53-379Z.md`) against `https://api.soar.luckysparrow.ch`; `/workers/*` and `/metrics` probes returned `403` from public network due ops-network guardrails, so Gate 2 remains open pending collector execution from VPS/private ops network.
- 2026-04-06: Added subscription + entitlement rollout baseline for collaborator testing readiness (`FREE/ADVANCED/PROFESSIONAL`, profile active-plan visibility, owner PROFESSIONAL bootstrap, admin-editable limits/pricing, and payment-gateway abstraction) via `history/plans/subscription-entitlements-rollout-plan-2026-04-06.md`.
- 2026-04-06: Refreshed RC external-gates/sign-off artifacts (`v1-rc-external-gates-status.md`, `v1-rc-signoff-record.md`) and added Binance live-ops verification checklist (`history/plans/binance-live-ops-verification-checklist-2026-04-06.md`) with links in RC checklist/runbook/sign-off references.
