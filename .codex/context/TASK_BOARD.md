# TASK_BOARD

Last updated: 2026-04-18

## Agent Workflow Refresh (2026-04-18)

- This board is the canonical execution queue for CryptoSparrow / Soar.
- Active planning source remains `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`.
- If planning docs and this board drift, sync them before implementation.
- Default delivery loop for every execution slice:
  - plan
  - implement
  - run relevant tests and validations
  - capture architecture follow-up if discovered
  - sync task state, project state, planning docs, and learning journal when
    needed

## READY

  - Status: READY
  - Group: Dashboard Runtime Scope Remediation (`BRS-B`)
  - Owner: QA/Test
  - Depends on: BRS-04
  - Priority: P1

## BACKLOG

- [ ] BRS-06 Make PUT /dashboard/bots/:id update canonical group+strategy mapping transactionally
  - Status: BACKLOG
  - Group: Dashboard Runtime Scope Remediation (`BRS-B`)

## DONE

- [x] BRS-A closed implementation scope (`BRS-01..BRS-04`): selected-bot runtime scope foundation (decision + regression + repository/service hardening)
- [x] BRS-04 Prevent runtime symbol expansion beyond canonical selected-bot scope
- [x] BRS-03 Narrow runtime read filters to `ACTIVE` canonical groups/links only
- [x] BRS-02 Add failing API regression for selected-bot symbol leakage across canonical/legacy/session/event paths
- [x] BRS planning queued: `BRS-01..BRS-12` selected-bot runtime scope remediation wave published and promoted to NOW/NEXT/PIPELINE in canonical queue
- [x] BRS-01 Close selected-bot runtime scope policy (`ACTIVE` canonical only, `PAUSED` exclusion default)
- [x] QH-TSC-01 Add canonical web verification script (`build -> typecheck`) and document it for closure packs
- [x] QH-LINT-02 Resolve remaining `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings in backtests/wallets table components
- [x] QH-LINT-01 Remove `no-unused-vars` warning noise in web build-critical dashboard/bots files
- [x] SOAR-000 Establish Soar-specific agent workflow scaffolding refresh
- [x] L10NQ-D-06..10 Reports, markets, backtests, bots, and dashboard-home copy migration completed and reflected in `docs/planning/mvp-next-commits.md`
- [x] UXR-F-A closed: `UXR-F-01..UXR-F-04` (contract freeze + shared `ui/forms` core/fields + import-boundary guardrail enforcement)
- [x] UXR-F-05 Unify dashboard create/edit wrappers with shared shell and namespace-driven copy
- [x] UXR-F-06 Migrate wallet create/edit form to shared ui/forms primitives
- [x] UXR-F-07 Migrate markets create/edit form to shared ui/forms primitives
- [x] UXR-F-08 Migrate backtests create form to shared ui/forms primitives
- [x] UXR-F-09 Migrate strategies create/edit form internals to shared ui/forms primitives
- [x] UXR-F-10 Migrate bots create/edit form internals to shared ui/forms primitives
- [x] UXR-F-11 Standardize form submit/disabled states and validation summary+focus behavior
- [x] UXR-F-12 Add reusable mobile sticky action bar pattern for long dashboard forms
- [x] UXR-F-13 Run focused cross-form regression pack for UXR-F-C
- [x] UXR-F-14 Publish UXR-F closure sync and evidence notes across canonical docs/context
- [x] UXR-F-D closed: `UXR-F-13..UXR-F-14` (focused regression + closure evidence + canonical queue sync)
