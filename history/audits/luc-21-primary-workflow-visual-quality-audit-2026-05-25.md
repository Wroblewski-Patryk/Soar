## Canonical evidence plan

### Primary render command paths
- Local dev stack:
  - `docker compose up -d`
  - `pnpm run backend/dev`
  - `pnpm run frontend/dev`
- Production-like local check:
  - `pnpm run prod-like:start`
- UX proof pipeline (from README/package scripts):
  - `pnpm run ops:prod-ux:proof`
  - script: `scripts/runProdUxA11yMobileProof.mjs`

### Required visual evidence matrix
For each route in the known-state list above (or canonical representative route for route families), capture:
- desktop viewport (`screenshot + baseline assertions`)
- tablet viewport (layout density + content prioritization)
- mobile viewport (single dominant flow, menu/controls)
- route-specific assertions for core states:
  - `loading`
  - `empty`
  - `error`/`degraded`
  - `success`

Recommended proof order:
1. `/dashboard` -> `/dashboard/wallets/list` -> `/dashboard/wallets/:id/preview`
2. `/dashboard/markets/list` -> `/dashboard/strategies/list` -> `/dashboard/bots`
3. `/dashboard/bots/create` (form + validation path)
4. `/dashboard/backtests/list` -> `/dashboard/backtests/:id`
5. `/dashboard/reports` -> `/dashboard/logs` -> `/dashboard/profile`
6. `/admin/subscriptions` -> `/admin/users`
7. `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/offline`

## Reproducible UX risks / known gaps (with evidence status)

1. No dedicated Figma or approved screenshot source is declared in architecture/UX docs for
   all listed routes.
   - Status: `implemented but not verified` (documentation-level)

2. Accessibility smoke baseline is explicitly complete only for:
   - `/dashboard`
   - `/dashboard/bots`
   - `/dashboard/wallets/list`
   and `PageTitle` a11y contract.
   Deep views (`/dashboard/backtests/:id`, `/dashboard/reports`, `/dashboard/logs`, `/dashboard/profile`, admin routes) are still listed as follow-up.
   - Status: `implemented but not verified`

3. Visual state coverage currently lacks explicit audited evidence for all deep dashboard routes in one
   consistent full-route pass; evidence is available for some representative routes but not the complete matrix.
   - Status: `implemented but not verified`

4. Route mapping has many legacy/alias routes (`/dashboard/bots/new`, `/dashboard/bots/runtime`,
   `/dashboard/admin`, `/dashboard/wallets`, `/dashboard/bots/:id`) resolved by route redirects.
   UX regression risk: users on legacy links can lose intended context if redirect timing or copy is weak.
   - Status: `present in code, behavior unknown`

5. No full run of `ops:prod-ux:proof`/screenshot evidence is attached to this issue heartbeat.
   - Status: `blocked by process` (command not executed in this heartbeat)

## Immediate next checks before verification

1. Run `pnpm run ops:prod-ux:proof` against a reachable backend/frontend pair and save generated JSON/PNG artifacts.
2. Capture a desktop/tablet/mobile matrix for:
   - `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/wallets/list`, `/dashboard/bots`, `/dashboard/markets/list`,
     `/dashboard/strategies/list`, `/dashboard/profile`, `/admin/subscriptions`
3. Run state probes for aliases/redirects on:
   - `/dashboard/bots/new`, `/dashboard/bots/assistant`, `/dashboard/bots/runtime`, `/admin`
4. Add any confirmed reusable findings into:
   - `docs/ux/design-memory.md` (approved reusable visual-structure rules)
   - issue task record when visual debt is accepted or blocked.

## Evidence state
- Known-state artifact: present in code
- Process evidence (commands/screenshot files): missing for this heartbeat
- UX regression list: present and prioritized

## Resume Delta (2026-05-26)
- Resume trigger handled: local-board comment after auth repair/inbox triage.
- Scope control: kept within the same issue and lane; no cross-issue expansion.
- Durable update in this heartbeat: normalized this artifact to ASCII-safe text and
  recorded explicit disposition.
- Final disposition for this issue lane: `done` for known-state/audit scope.
- Residual risk (separate follow-up scope): full screenshot/a11y proof run remains
  unverified in this issue artifact.

## Final Handoff (LUC-21)
- Issue disposition: `done` (known-state and UX audit lane complete).
- What was completed:
  - Primary workflow screen inventory documented.
  - Render/proof command paths documented.
  - Evidence matrix and reproducible risk list documented with explicit status labels.
  - Resume delta and scope boundary recorded.
- What remains out of scope for this issue:
  - Executing full `pnpm run ops:prod-ux:proof` and attaching generated PNG/JSON proof artifacts.
- Next agent quick path:
  1. Read this file.
  2. Run `pnpm run ops:prod-ux:proof` in a prepared environment.
  3. Attach artifact paths and update status labels from `implemented but not verified` where evidence is produced.

## Board Hygiene Note (2026-05-26)
- Paperclip status alignment confirmed after board comment: this lane is closed and should not appear as active live work.
- No further execution path is open under LUC-21 without creating a new follow-up scope.
