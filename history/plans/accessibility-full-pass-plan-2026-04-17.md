# Accessibility Full Pass Plan (2026-04-17)

Goal: close post-MVP full accessibility scope with explicit timeline, measurable gates, and evidence artifacts.

## Why This Plan Exists
- MVP and V1 already delivered baseline accessibility for core dashboard flows.
- Canonical open decision required one missing item: full-pass timeline and closure path.
- This plan defines tiny-commit execution tasks for that closure.

## Scope
- In scope:
  - Dashboard shell and high-traffic dashboard modules (`home`, `bots`, `markets`, `orders`, `positions`, `wallets`, `profile`).
  - Accessibility regression protection in tests and QA runbooks.
  - Canonical docs updates and evidence links.
- Out of scope:
  - Mobile-native app accessibility (separate track).
  - Major visual redesign work unrelated to accessibility compliance.

## Execution Timeline (Target)
- Week 1:
  - `A11Y-01` plan freeze + decision closure.
  - `A11Y-02` automated route-level accessibility baseline.
- Week 2:
  - `A11Y-03` priority remediation batch.
  - `A11Y-04` manual keyboard and screen-reader smoke pack.
- Week 3:
  - `A11Y-05` closure evidence, docs sync, and release gate update.

## Tiny-Commit Task List
- [x] `A11Y-01 docs(plan): publish full-pass timeline and resolve Accessibility Scope decision`
- [x] `A11Y-02 test(web-a11y): add automated accessibility smoke for core dashboard routes`
- [x] `A11Y-03 fix(web-a11y): remediate highest-priority issues from A11Y-02 findings`
- [x] `A11Y-04 qa(a11y-manual): run keyboard + screen-reader smoke checklist and capture evidence`
- [x] `A11Y-05 docs(closure): update canonical runbooks/plans and publish closure evidence artifact`

## Completion Log
- 2026-04-17: Completed `A11Y-02` by adding route-level smoke suite `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.a11y.smoke.test.tsx` and `PageTitle` a11y contract tests in `apps/web/src/ui/layout/dashboard/PageTitle.a11y.test.tsx`.
- 2026-04-17: Completed `A11Y-03` by remediating `PageTitle` semantics (`breadcrumb` landmark and contextual SR description for generic `Create` action).
- 2026-04-17: Completed `A11Y-04` + `A11Y-05` by publishing checklist and evidence artifacts:
  - `history/artifacts/_artifacts-a11y-full-pass-2026-04-17T00-17-35-000Z.json`
  - `history/plans/a11y-full-pass-closure-2026-04-17.md`
  - `docs/ux/dashboard-accessibility-baseline.md`

## Exit Criteria
- Automated accessibility smoke passes for selected core routes.
- Manual keyboard and screen-reader checklist completed with evidence.
- Known critical accessibility issues are closed or explicitly risk-accepted.
- Canonical planning/docs files are synchronized with closure status.
