# V1 Launch Review and V1.1 Backlog Cut (2026-03-21)

Scope note: this review is based on pre-launch and local production-like evidence (not a public 7-day production window yet).

## Review Inputs
- RC and launch evidence pack:
  - `history/evidence/v1-launch-evidence-pack.md`
- Load/performance baseline:
  - `history/audits/v1-load-baseline-2026-03-21.md`
- Security verification:
  - `history/audits/security-audit-verification-2026-03-21.md`
- Cutover and rollback readiness:
  - `docs/operations/v1-local-cutover-checklist.md`
  - `docs/operations/v1-local-rollback-checklist.md`
  - `history/plans/v1-local-cutover-dry-run-2026-03-21.md`

## KPI Snapshot (Evidence Window)
- Availability / uptime: local readiness probes green in verification runs.
- API error rate: `0.0000` in load baseline run.
- Latency: p95 `37ms`, p99 `72ms` in load baseline run.
- Worker queue lag trend: no lag pressure observed in local evidence window.
- Order failure/retry trend: no regression signal in focused verification suites.
- User-reported critical issues: none in current local validation cycle.

## What Went Well
- Runtime replacement path is implemented and evidence-backed (stream -> signal -> order -> position).
- Security baseline is stable (auth/ownership/key-flow verification suite green).
- Cutover + rollback operational playbooks are now explicit and reviewable.
- Launch evidence is centralized in one pack.

## What Did Not Go Well
- Exit gates still depend on production-only evidence (backup/restore, real telemetry window, formal sign-offs).
- SLO observation in true production window is not yet collected.

## Root Causes and Lessons
- Main remaining risk is operational readiness on target environment, not missing core implementation.
- Explicit runbooks and evidence artifacts reduce launch ambiguity and should be mandatory before final sign-off.

## V1.1 Backlog Cut (Prioritized)
- [x] P0: automate backup snapshot + restore verification pipeline with auditable logs (`ops:db:backup-restore:check-local` + timestamped txt/md artifacts).
- [x] P0: add schedule-ready SLO reporting job (`ops:slo:window-report`) for 7d/30d snapshots from collected metrics/alerts artifacts.
- [x] P1: add queue-lag trend export with threshold breach timeline in generated SLO window report output.
- [x] P1: build sign-off workflow artifact automation (`ops:rc:signoff:build`) for Engineering/Product/Ops approvals and RC owner assignment record.
- [x] P2: expand cutover dry-run suite into one command orchestration script (`ops:cutover:dry-run`) with structured JSON+Markdown report output.

## Decisions and Owners
- Decision: proceed to final launch only after external production gates are evidenced and signed.
  - Owner: release owner (to be assigned in `docs/operations/v1-rc-signoff-record.md`)
  - Due date: before public launch trigger

## Sign-Off (Review Document)
- Engineering: prepared (pending named approver in RC sign-off record)
- Product: prepared (pending named approver in RC sign-off record)
- Operations: prepared (pending named approver in RC sign-off record)
