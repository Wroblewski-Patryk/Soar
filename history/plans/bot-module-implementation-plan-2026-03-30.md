# Bot Module Implementation Plan (BMOD) - 2026-03-30

Status: reconciled with canonical plan (2026-04-05), tiny-commit mode.

## Objective
Deliver a production-safe bot module that reuses shared backtest/runtime logic while simplifying bot creation and runtime monitoring.

## Hard Constraints (locked)
- Only two bot modes are allowed: `PAPER` and `LIVE`.
- Bot creator uses `Strategy` + `Market Group` selection.
- `paperStartBalance` is visible only in `PAPER` mode.
- `positionMode` is removed from bot-creator flow for now.
- `maxOpenPositions` is not user-entered in bot creator; value is derived from strategy risk config.
- Runtime should be websocket-first.
- Bot monitoring view is table/statistics driven without heavy candlestick charts.
- No unrelated feature/UX changes outside bot module scope.

## Runtime Semantics (locked)
- Strategy decision trigger: closed/final candle stream events.
- Position management trigger: ticker stream events (for open position lifecycle automation).
- Scan loop is fallback watchdog only and disabled by default in normal operation.
- Shared logic sources remain mandatory:
  - shared execution decision core,
  - shared strategy evaluator,
  - shared position lifecycle manager.

## Done Criteria
- Bot creator is reduced to required controls and produces canonical V2 payload.
- Runtime behavior is stream-first and parity-safe with shared decision contracts.
- Bot monitoring is available without heavy chart rendering and remains responsive for multi-pair bots.
- Legacy fallback paths are either removed or explicitly scoped to transition-only behavior.
- Full tests pass and operational docs are updated.
