# UXR-E Table Actions + Clone + Dashboard Polish Plan (2026-04-18)

Status: closed (UXR-E-A..UXR-E-C completed 2026-04-18)  
Execution mode: tiny-commit only (exactly one task per commit)  
Primary audience: implementation agent

## Start Gate
- Do not start this wave before active `L10NQ-D` queue is finished.
- When `L10NQ-D` is closed, execute `UXR-E-01..UXR-E-12` in order.

## Source Request (condensed)
- Add `clone/duplicate` action in list tables (`wallets`, `markets`, `strategies`) and make clones clearly named as cloned.
- Standardize table action buttons so repeated actions share one visual/system contract across modules; still allow dedicated module actions.
- Align action icon/color semantics in:
  - `markets list` (edit style)
  - `strategies list` (edit style)
  - `backtests list` (preview icon/color)
  - `bots list` (edit style + runtime action color)
- Dashboard:
  - move `Manual order` under wallet context and improve UX
  - select symbol from active bot runtime symbols
  - side as switch/pill with icon style
  - show quantity-derived value based on leverage and current symbol price
- Wallet KPI visual cleanup in dashboard sidebar:
  - portfolio in simple row style (without icon card look)
  - free funds / in positions without icons/background
  - optional border tint tied to percent tone
- Header/breadcrumb action button polish:
  - remove forced size (`btn-xs`, `h-*`, `min-h-*`) from page-title action base class
  - increase actions container gap from `gap-1` style usage to `gap-3` in target container
- Footer:
  - remove `(PT)` suffix from Portuguese label in language switcher
  - center mobile footer rows in both dashboard and public shell

## Default Decisions (locked for implementation)
1. Clone naming contract:
   - New name format: `<original name> (clone)`.
   - If collision occurs, append counter: `<original name> (clone 2)`, `<clone 3>`, etc.
2. Clone scope:
   - Clone only user-editable config fields for the same module entity.
   - Never copy runtime/execution history IDs.
3. Action system contract:
   - Shared action presets live in one place (`TableUi`) with semantic tones and canonical icons.
   - Same action type must always use same icon and tone across modules.
   - Dedicated actions (for example `runtime`, `preview`, `details`, `clone`) extend the same base style.
4. Manual order side UX:
   - UI shows direction pill-style switch with icon semantics.
   - Payload contract remains backend-safe (`BUY` / `SELL`) via explicit mapping.
5. Quantity valuation preview:
   - Show read-only estimates: notional (`qty * price`) and margin estimate (`notional / leverage`) when inputs are resolvable.
6. Footer locale label contract:
   - User-facing locale label is `Portuguese`/localized equivalent, without `(PT)` suffix.

## Execution Groups (commit batches)
1. `UXR-E-A (commits UXR-E-01..UXR-E-04): table action system + clone foundation`
2. `UXR-E-B (commits UXR-E-05..UXR-E-08): action rollout + dashboard manual-order/wallet UX`
3. `UXR-E-C (commits UXR-E-09..UXR-E-12): shell polish + regressions + closure`
