# UXR-F Dashboard Create/Edit Forms UX/UI Unification Plan (2026-04-18)

Status: closed (UXR-F-A..UXR-F-D completed 2026-04-18)  
Execution mode: tiny-commit only (exactly one task per commit)  
Primary audience: implementation agent

## Start Gate
- Do not interrupt active `NOW` queue.
- Keep this wave queued behind currently active/queued waves (`L10NQ-D`, `DBSEL-A`, `UXR-E`).
- Promote `UXR-F-01..` to `NOW` only when earlier queue waves are closed or explicitly reprioritized.

## Goal
- Unify dashboard create/edit form UX/UI with one reusable form system.
- Preserve strengths of `strategies/create` (clear sectioning and flow).
- Remove form-control cross-feature coupling.
- Align i18n, breadcrumb, validation, and submission ergonomics across create/edit pages.

## Scope (target routes)
- `/dashboard/wallets/create` and `/dashboard/wallets/[id]/edit`
- `/dashboard/markets/create` and `/dashboard/markets/[id]/edit`
- `/dashboard/strategies/create` and `/dashboard/strategies/[id]/edit`
- `/dashboard/backtests/create`
- `/dashboard/bots/create` and `/dashboard/bots/[id]/edit`

## Current Baseline Findings (code inventory)
- Form controls are fragmented:
  - dedicated local controls in markets (`FieldControls`)
  - hand-rolled field markup in wallets/bots/backtests
  - strategy uses tabbed custom sections with local locale branching.
- Backtest form currently imports field controls from markets (`cross-feature coupling`).
- Multiple page wrappers still use local in-component locale maps or hardcoded copy instead of namespace keys.
- Form spacing and grid density differs strongly between modules (notably bots/wallets).

## Implementation Contract (locked)
1. Shared form primitives live under `apps/web/src/ui/forms/*` and become the only source for generic form field rendering.
2. Minimum required primitives:
   - `FormPageShell`
   - `FormSectionCard`
   - `FormGrid`
   - `FormField`
   - `TextField`, `NumberField`, `SelectField`, `TextareaField`, `ToggleField`, `RadioGroupField`, `RangeField`, `CompoundField`
   - `FormAlert`, `FormValidationSummary`
3. DaisyUI/Tailwind remain baseline styling system.
4. Route wrappers must use i18n namespace keys (no inline locale dictionaries for page copy).
5. Cross-feature imports of generic controls are forbidden (only `ui/forms` for shared field primitives).
6. Validation UX is standardized:
   - inline field errors
   - top summary block
   - scroll/focus first invalid field on submit.
7. Submission UX is standardized:
   - consistent disabled/loading/submitting behavior
   - no double-submit race.
8. Long forms support improved ergonomics:
   - sections/tabs where appropriate (especially markets)
   - mobile sticky action bar pattern when form length warrants it.

## Execution Groups
1. `UXR-F-A (UXR-F-01..UXR-F-04): shared form foundation + guardrails`
2. `UXR-F-B (UXR-F-05..UXR-F-08): i18n/page-shell alignment + wallets/markets/backtests migration`
3. `UXR-F-C (UXR-F-09..UXR-F-12): strategies/bots migration + mobile ergonomics`
4. `UXR-F-D (UXR-F-13..UXR-F-14): regression pack + closure evidence`

## Stage Definition of Done (DoD)

### Stage A DoD (`UXR-F-A`)
- `ui/forms` base primitives exist and are tested.
- Guardrail prevents new cross-feature generic field imports.
- No runtime behavior change in feature flows yet.

### Stage B DoD (`UXR-F-B`)
- Wrappers for scoped routes use namespace keys and unified shell.
- Wallets/markets/backtests forms use `ui/forms` controls.
- Backtest no longer imports form controls from markets.

### Stage C DoD (`UXR-F-C`)
- Strategies and bots forms aligned visually/structurally to shared system.
- Validation summary + first-error focus and submit-state contract applied across scoped forms.
- Mobile sticky action pattern active for long forms where needed.

### Stage D DoD (`UXR-F-D`)
- Focused tests, typecheck, and build pass.
- Queue/planning logs updated with closure evidence.

## Stage Risks and Rollback Plan

### Stage A Risk / Rollback
- Risk:
  - Over-designed primitives may create migration friction.
- Rollback:
  - Keep primitives additive; do not remove old controls until Stage B migration commits succeed.

### Stage B Risk / Rollback
- Risk:
  - i18n key drift in wrappers or accidental validation regressions while migrating fields.
- Rollback:
  - Revert per-form migration commit independently; wrapper/i18n commit remains isolated.

### Stage C Risk / Rollback
- Risk:
  - Strategy/bot complex forms may regress layout density or toggle behavior.
  - Sticky action bar may overlap content on specific breakpoints.
- Rollback:
  - Revert only the affected form commit (strategies or bots) and keep previous migrated forms intact.
  - Keep sticky bar behind opt-in prop to disable quickly per form.

### Stage D Risk / Rollback
- Risk:
  - Late regression discovered in integrated smoke path.
- Rollback:
  - Use tiny-commit granularity to revert only failing final migration commit(s), not whole wave.
