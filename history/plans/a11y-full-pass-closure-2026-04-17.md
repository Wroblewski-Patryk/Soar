- Status: `PASS`
- Covered routes: `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/bots`, `/dashboard/wallets/list`

## Delivered

  - contextual screen-reader description for generic `Create` actions.
- Published evidence artifacts and synchronized canonical planning files.

## Executed Validation

## Manual-Checklist Evidence (A11Y-04)
- [PASS] Keyboard navigation sanity for dashboard shell interactions (menu toggle, route actions).
